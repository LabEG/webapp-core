   A library for enforcing and sharing consistent code style across projects.

2. **[ts-serializable](https://github.com/labeg/ts-serializable)**
   A TypeScript library for serializing and deserializing objects with strong typing.

3. **[@labeg/tfetch](https://github.com/labeg/tfetch)**
   A lightweight wrapper around the Fetch API with additional features for easier HTTP requests.
